### Description for the run_Analysis.R file ###

This is a github repo for the submission of the personal project of getting and cleaning data.

##Overview
This project demonstrates the collection and cleaning of clean data set that is then used for analysis. Full description of the data set can be found here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The source data for this project can be found at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

To use the script remember to set the correct path variables to your preferred working paths on lines 6 and 27. Otherwise the script will not work. 

## Project Summary


Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. <br>
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The codeBook.MD file contains more information about the variables used and how the script works.
